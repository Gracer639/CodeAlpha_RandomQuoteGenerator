Project Update: Random Quote Generator App (Task 2 – CodeAlpha Internship)

As part of my learning journey with CodeAlpha, I built a simple yet fun Random Quote Generator using React + Vite. 🎉

🔹 Features:
✅ Displays a random quote each time you open the app
✅ "New Quote" button to generate different quotes instantly
✅ Shows both quote text and author clearly
✅ Clean and minimal user-friendly UI

🔹 Tech Stack:

React (Vite for fast setup ⚡)

JavaScript (for logic)

CSS (for styling)
