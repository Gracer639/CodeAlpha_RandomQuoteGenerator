#Project Update: Random Quote Generator App (Task 2 â€“ CodeAlpha Internship)

As part of my learning journey with CodeAlpha, I built a simple yet fun Random Quote Generator using React + Vite. 

 Features:
Displays a random quote each time you open the app
 "New Quote" button to generate different quotes instantly
Shows both quote text and author clearly
 Clean and minimal user-friendly UI

Tech Stack:

React (Vite for fast setup )

JavaScript (for logic)

CSS (for styling)
